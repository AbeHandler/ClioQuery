    Aabstract = "Search applications often display shortened sentences which must contain certain query terms and must fit within the space constraints of a user interface. This work introduces a new transition-based sentence compression technique developed for such settings. Our query-focused method constructs length and lexically constrained compressions in linear time, by growing a subgraph in the dependency parse of a sentence. This theoretically efficient approach achieves an 11x empirical speedup over baseline ILP methods, while better reconstructing gold constrained shortenings. Such speedups help query-focused applications, because users are measurably hindered by interface lags. Additionally, our technique does not require an ILP solver or a GPU.",

However what people say they do and what they actually do are not always consistent. It is necessary to understand, acknowledge and identify the cause of this inconsistency. We must identify the physical and cognitive factors to develop better methods and tools, assisting with the search process. This paper discusses the limitations and myths of Ctrl-f in information seeking. A prototype system for within-document search is introduced. Three user studies portray shared behaviour and attitudes, common between participants regarding within-document searching.},

abstract = {The design and presentation of a Search Engine Results Page (SERP) has been subject to much research. With many contemporary aspects of the SERP now under scrutiny, work still remains in investigating more traditional SERP components, such as the result summary. Prior studies have examined a variety of different aspects of result summaries, but in this paper we investigate the influence of result summary length on search behaviour, performance and user experience. To this end, we designed and conducted a within-subjects experiment using the TREC AQUAINT news collection with 53 participants. Using Kullback-Leibler distance as a measure of information gain, we examined result summaries of different lengths and selected four conditions where the change in information gain was the greatest: (i) title only; (ii) title plus one snippet; (iii) title plus two snippets; and (iv) title plus four snippets. Findings show that participants broadly preferred longer result summaries, as they were perceived to be more informative. However, their performance in terms of correctly identifying relevant documents was similar across all four conditions. Furthermore, while the participants felt that longer summaries were more informative, empirical observations suggest otherwise; while participants were more likely to click on relevant items given longer summaries, they also were more likely to click on non-relevant items. This shows that longer is not necessarily better, though participants perceived that to be the case - and second, they reveal a positive relationship between the length and informativeness of summaries and their attractiveness (i.e. clickthrough rates). These findings show that there are tensions between perception and performance when designing result summaries that need to be taken into account.},

Despite increased interest in the community and notable research effort, progress on benchmark datasets has stagnated. We critically evaluate key ingredients of the current research setup: datasets, evaluation metrics, and models, and highlight three primary shortcomings: 1) automatically collected datasets leave the task underconstrained and may contain noise detrimental to training and evaluation, 2) current evaluation protocol is weakly correlated with human judgment and does not account for important characteristics such as factual correctness, 3) models overfit to layout biases of current datasets and offer limited diversity in their outputs.",

 abstract = {Prompted by the media's coverage of Hurricane Katrina, our article looks at the use of refugee as a label for American citizens. Referring to archived articles from The New York Times, we first demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief the label has been used to represent Americans at home for some time. We then examine when refugee appeared in The New York Times' coverage of Katrina, and how it positioned those it designated, and argue that it was the media's perception of a lack of control, both at the individual and governmental level, that prompted its use. After addressing the accompanying controversy over the use of refugee in the coverage of Katrina, we discuss the dilemma the media face when a particular lexical item that they consider denotatively appropriate is considered inappropriate by the public. We explain this as a matter of conflicting presuppositions.},

 abstract = {This article examines how a diverse set of British commentators wrestled with the shifting intersections between race, slave agency, and the violence of the Haitian Revolution between 1971 and 1805. In late 1791, the news of growing slave unrest in Saint-Domingue sent waves of anxiety across the Atlantic world. But while the ensuing violence immediately appalled contemporary observers, other preoccupations—geopolitical, commercial, and military concerns—initially dominated the Revolution’s reception in Britain. Exploring a varied range of authors, newspapers, and texts, this article explores a gradual shift towards the racialization of slave violence over the following years. By the early 1800s, British representations had begun to regularly conceive of insurgent acts of violence as more than Jacobinism writ black, theorizing in different ways about their racial dimensions. At the same time, with the onset of the Napoleonic Wars, heroic depictions of the most prominent revolutionary leaders—namely Toussaint Louverture—could also be mobilized as racial exceptions against both popular sources of black violence and the brutality of the French army. Throughout the revolutionary decade, however, these British accounts of the slaves’ insurrectionary violence were consistently marked by an underlying erasure of their agency.},

 abstract = {Over the past four decades, the United States has experienced an acrimonious debate regarding Mexican migration, particularly that labeled "illegal/undocumented." A central dimension in the debate is the discursive opposition of the labels "illegal" versus "undocumented" migrant. The labels are dominant political signifíers, yet their overlapping formation and juridicopolitical context have been largely overlooked. This article traces the genealogy of these labels, presents some of the academic uses of these, and analyzes the shared premises and limitations of both terms. The essay argues that the inattention to the genealogy of the terminology and shared limitations have obscured the role of the label "undocumented" migrant in supporting the production of "illegality," despite its emergence as an explicitly oppositional term to "illegal alien/immigrant."},

The pleasures include working at one's home or office computer rather than taking lengthy trips to city and state libraries and, more important, discovering a wealth of unexpected documents that can change the direction of one's analysis or argument. The perils, however, are many: different newspaper databases can be very uneven in what they choose to digitize (and their principles inexplicable), their keyword searches can be unreliable and inconsistent, and their virtuality eliminates the community of librarians, archivists, and other researchers with whom one can confer at an actual site.},

 abstract = {From the standpoint of the existing literature on cultural categories of worthiness or deservingness, school funding equalization presents a paradox: why has a reform targeted at morally deserving children been so difficult to enact? This article investigates cultural constructions of worthiness, which have been shown to affect the debate and implementation of social welfare policies, in this new policy arena. The authors analyze newspaper coverage in California and Texas, over multiple time periods, to explore whether and how arguments about deservingness of the policy’s beneficiaries appear in debates surrounding school finance reform. The authors find that even though children are widely accepted to be morally worthy, the deservingness of other groups complicates the debate. The deservingness of taxpayers, teachers and administrators, and parents is contested, and can challenge or dilute claims about the deservingness of children. These findings help make sense of the paradoxes of school finance reform by showing how deservingness can still be contested even though the target population is widely accepted to be morally worthy.},

Research questions focused on the ensemble's (1) origin and time frame, (2) service to the school and community, (3) instructors, (4) instrumentation, (5) performances, (6) funding, and (7) influence on other school bands. The Chicago Reform School was established in 1855 to provide a home and education for juvenile offenders. In addition to their academic study and vocational training, several students participated in a band that was organized around 1862 and modeled after military bands of the time. By 1866, this ensemble consisted of a fife and drum corps and a brass band that were funded by performances given throughout the city. Alfred D. Langan was the first known director, followed by Thomas R Westendorf and Hugh Goodwin. Instrumental music continued at the CRS until around 1872, when the institution was closed due to legal issues and the partial destruction of its facilities by the Great Chicago Fire.},

The classification consists of three hierarchical levels of informational, navigational, and transactional intent. After deriving attributes of each, we then developed a software application that automatically classified queries using a Web search engine log of over a million and a half queries submitted by several hundred thousand users. Our findings show that more than 80% of Web queries are informational in nature, with about 10% each being navigational and transactional. In order to validate the accuracy of our algorithm, we manually coded 400 queries and compared the results from this manual classification to the results determined by the automated method. This comparison showed that the automatic classification has an accuracy of 74%. Of the remaining 25% of the queries, the user intent is vague or multi-faceted, pointing to the need for probabilistic classification. We discuss how search engines can use knowledge of user intent to provide more targeted and relevant results in Web searching."

This article describes the application of analysis methods from two distinct fields, one method from interpretive social science and one method from statistical machine learning, to the same survey data. The results show that the two analyses produce some similar and some complementary insights about the phenomenon of interest, in this case, nonuse of social media. We compare both the processes of conducting these analyses and the results they produce to derive insights about each method's unique advantages and drawbacks, as well as the broader roles that these methods play in the respective fields where they are often used. These insights allow us to make more informed decisions about the tradeoffs in choosing different methods for analyzing textual data. Furthermore, this comparison suggests ways that such methods might be combined in novel and compelling ways.},

However, strict surface-structure dependency trees tend to follow the linguistic structure of sentences too closely and frequently fail to provide direct relations between content words. To mitigate this problem, the original Stanford Dependencies representation also defines two dependency graph representations which contain additional and augmented relations that explicitly capture otherwise implicit relations between content words. In this paper, we revisit and extend these dependency graph representations in light of the recent Universal Dependencies (UD) initiative and provide a detailed account of an enhanced and an enhanced++ English UD representation. We further present a converter from constituency to basic, i.e., strict surface structure, UD trees, and a converter from basic UD trees to enhanced and enhanced++ English UD graphs. We release both converters as part of Stanford CoreNLP and the Stanford Parser.",

Motivated by the needs of novel user interfaces, we define the task and give examples of its application. We also present a new query-focused method for finding natural language sentences which express relationships. Our method allows for summarization of more than two times more query pairs than baseline relation extractors, while returning measurably more readable output. Finally, to help guide future work, we analyze the challenges of relational summarization using both a news and a social media corpus.",

One application is to support hypertext browsing by providing glosses for link anchors. This paper describes an observational study of the impact of Fluid Documents on reading and browsing. The study involved six conditions that differ along several dimensions, including the degree of typographic adjustment and the distance glosses are placed from anchors. Six subjects read and answered questions about two hypertext corpora while being monitored by an eyetracker. The eyetracking data revealed no substantial differenccs in eye behavior between conditions. Gloss placement was significant: subjects required less time to use nearby glosses. Finally, the reaction to the conditions was highly varied, with several conditions receiving both a best and worst rating on the subjective questionnaires. These results suggest implications for the design of dynamic reading environments.},

abstract = {Search engines help their users decide which results to visit using captions comprising titles, URLs, and snippets containing the query keywords and proximal text from landing pages (the search results linked from the result page). Although caption content can be a key factor in these decisions, snippets provide only basic support for orienting users with landing page content from the search-engine result page (SERP), and no support during the transition to landing pages or once users reach the page following a selection decision. As a result, many searchers must employ inefficient strategies such as skimming and scanning the content of the landing page. In this paper we propose a novel method, called clickable snippets, to address this shortcoming. Clickable snippets provide searchers with a direct and actionable link between SERP captions and landing-page content. We describe a user study comparing clickable snippets with extant methods of orientation support such as query-term highlighting on the landing page and thumbnail previews on the SERP. We show that clickable snippets are preferred by participants, and lead to more effective and efficient searching. Our findings have implications for the design of the user experience in search systems.},

Many such systems exist, ranging from computer-aided design (CAD) systems for chip design that display both the logical structure and the actual geometry of the integrated circuit to overview-plus-detail systems that show both an overview for context and a zoomed-in-view for detail. Designers of these systems must make a variety of design decisions, ranging from determining layout to constructing sophisticated coordination mechanisms. Surprisingly, little work has been done to characterize these systems or to express guidelines for their design. Based on a workshop discussion of multiple views, and based on our own design and implementation experience with these systems, we present eight guidelines for the design of multiple view systems.},

In this work, we study the task of identifying products being bought and sold in online cybercrime forums, which exhibits particularly challenging cross-domain effects. We formulate a task that represents a hybrid of slot-filling information extraction and named entity recognition and annotate data from four different forums. Each of these forums constitutes its own {``}fine-grained domain{''} in that the forums cover different market sectors with different properties, even though all forums are in the broad domain of cybercrime. We characterize these domain differences in the context of a learning-based system: supervised models see decreased accuracy when applied to new forums, and standard techniques for semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation have limited effectiveness on this data, which suggests the need to improve these techniques. We release a dataset of 1,938 annotated posts from across the four forums.",

abstract = {A proposal for a unified theory of learned trust implemented in a cognitive architecture is presented. The theory is instantiated as a computational cognitive model of learned trust that integrates several seemingly unrelated categories of findings from the literature on interpersonal and human-machine interactions and makes unintuitive predictions for future studies. The model relies on a combination of learning mechanisms to explain a variety of phenomena such as trust asymmetry, the higher impact of early trust breaches, the black-hat/white-hat effect, the correlation between trust and cognitive ability, and the higher resilience of interpersonal as compared to human-machine trust. In addition, the model predicts that trust decays in the absence of evidence of trustworthiness or untrustworthiness. The implications of the model for the advancement of the theory on trust are discussed. Specifically, this work suggests two more trust antecedents on the trustor's side: perceived trust necessity and cognitive ability to detect cues of trustworthiness.},

In both cases, practitioners create situations for people to engage, and the results may be of interest to the research community. Scientific researchers need to be able to defend the logic of each step of their process from hypothesis to test to theory. Design, in contrast, relies simply on the success of the artefacts it creates. This implies a great degree of methodological liberty, including the potential to create open-ended designs that occasion new and illuminating engagements with the world.",

This article surveys the main control problems that arise when a system is composed of several anytime algorithms. These problems relate to optimal management of uncertainty and precision.

Yet understanding this prior process of historical inquiry might help us to develop improved services and facilities for scholars. A study of twenty American historians was conducted in order to better understand the nature of research in history. Respondents were asked about their choice of research topics, specific projects in progress, use of archives, categorization of materials collected, writing habits, and use of computers. Interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using standard, qualitative techniques. The results are discussed in the light of previous investigations of historians and the published statements of classification experts regarding the organization of historical knowledge. Suggestions for future study of historians are offered, and implications for libraries are explored.},

Theoretically, it describes three principles of system design which we believe must be followed to produce a useful and easy to use computer system. These principles are: early and continual focus on users; empirical measurement of usage; and iterative design whereby the system (simulated, prototype, and real) is modified, tested, modified again, tested again, and the cycle is repeated again and again. This approach is contrasted to other principled design approaches, for example, get it right the first time, reliance on design guidelines. Empirically, the article presents data which show that our design principles are not always intuitive to designers; identifies the arguments which designers often offer for not using these principles—and answers them; and provides an example in which our principles have been used successfully.},

The aim of this study is to identify user interests in different parts of an online collection and investigate the related search behavior. To do this, we propose to use the metadata of selected facets and clicked documents as features for clustering sessions identified in user logs. We evaluate the session clusters by measuring their stability over a six-month period.We apply our approach to data from the National Library of the Netherlands, a typical digital library with a richly annotated historical newspaper collection and a faceted search interface. Our results show that users interested in specific parts of the collection use different search techniques. We demonstrate that a metadata-based clustering helps to reveal and understand user interests in terms of the collection, and how search behavior is related to specific parts within the collection.},

The research was conducted in real-life setting using interview and shadowing. The following task process types were identified: (i) searching secondary sources, (ii) reading and making notes, (iii) collecting and processing data, (iv) analyzing and (v) writing. We found that IR interfaces were not always optimal for historians' use, and that the interfaces should support the expression of information needs better. The data processing consumes a lot of historians' time and they could benefit from designing better tools. We also found out that task process types have an effect on how digital tools or data are being used. Therefore, the context in which the tool or data is being used, should be taken into account when designing tools for historians.},

The accelerating digitization of primary and secondary sources and the rise of full-text web-based search to access information within them has transformed historians’ research practice, radically diminishing the role of place-specific prior expertise as a prerequisite to discovery. Indeed, we can now find information without knowing where to look. This has incited remarkably little reflection among mainstream historians, but the consequences are profound. What has become newly possible? How do the new digital affordances relate to the current boom in transnational topics and approaches? How do the reach, speed, and granularity of digitized search impact our ability to reconstruct the supranational past? This essay heralds the novel forms of knowledge-generation made possible by technological transformations. It also attempts an accounting of all the ancillary learning that international research in an analog world once required.

These systems enable distributed exploration and evidence gathering, allowing many users to pool their effort as they discuss and analyze the data. We explore how adding lightweight tag and link structure to comments can aid this analysis process. We present CommentSpace, a collaborative system in which analysts comment on visualizations and websites and then use tags and links to organize findings and identify others'" contributions. In a pair of studies comparing CommentSpace to a system without support for tags and links, we find that a small, fixed vocabulary of tags (question, hypothesis, to-do) and links (evidence-for, evidence-against) helps analysts more consistently and accurately classify evidence and establish common ground. We also find that managing and incentivizing participation is important for analysts to progress from exploratory analysis to deeper analytical tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that tags and links can help teams complete evidence gathering and synthesis tasks and that organizing comments using tags and links improves analytic results.},

abstract = {The keyterm-based approach is arguably intuitive for users to direct text-clustering processes and adapt results to various applications in text analysis. Its way of markedly influencing the results, for instance, by expressing important terms in relevance order, requires little knowledge of the algorithm and has predictable effect, speeding up the task. This article first presents a text-clustering algorithm that can easily be extended into an interactive algorithm. We evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art clustering algorithms in unsupervised mode. Next, we propose three interactive versions of the algorithm based on keyterm labeling, document labeling, and hybrid labeling. We then demonstrate that keyterm labeling is more effective than document labeling in text clustering. Finally, we propose a visual approach to support the keyterm-based version of the algorithm. Visualizations are provided for the whole collection as well as for detailed views of document and cluster relationships. We show the effectiveness and flexibility of our framework, Vis-Kt, by presenting typical clustering cases on real text document collections. A user study is also reported that reveals overwhelmingly positive acceptance toward keyterm-based clustering.},

abstract = {Document clustering is a necessary step in various analytical and automated activities. When guided by the user, algorithms are tailored to imprint a perspective on the clustering process that reflects the user’s understanding of the dataset. More than just allow for customized adjustment of the clusters, a visual analytics approach will provide tools for the user to draw new insights on the collection. While contributing his or her perspective, the user will also acquire a deeper understanding of the data set. To that effect, we propose a novel visual analytics system for interactive document clustering. We built our system on top of clustering algorithms that can adapt to user’s feedback. In the proposed system, initial clustering is created based on the user-defined number of clusters and the selected clustering algorithm. A set of coordinated visualizations allow the examination of the dataset and the results of the clustering. The visualization provides the user with the highlights of individual documents and understanding of the evolution of documents over the time period to which they relate. The users then interact with the process by means of changing key-terms that drive the process according to their knowledge of the documents domain. In key-term-based interaction, the user assigns a set of key-terms to each target cluster to guide the clustering algorithm. We have improved that process with a novel algorithm for choosing proper seeds for the clustering. Results demonstrate that not only the system has improved considerably its precision, but also its effectiveness in the document-based decision making. A set of quantitative experiments and a user study have been conducted to show the advantages of the approach for document analytics based on clustering. We performed and reported on the use of the framework in a real decision-making scenario that relates users discussion by email to decision making in improving patient care. Results show that the framework is useful even for more complex data sets such as email conversations.},

abstract = {Whenever users engage in gathering and organizing new information, searching and browsing activities emerge at the core of the exploration process. As the process unfolds and new knowledge is acquired, interest drifts occur inevitably and need to be accounted for. Despite the advances in retrieval and recommender algorithms, real-world interfaces have remained largely unchanged: results are delivered in a relevance-ranked list. However, it quickly becomes cumbersome to reorganize resources along new interests, as any new search brings new results. We introduce an interactive user-driven tool that aims at supporting users in understanding, refining, and reorganizing documents on the fly as information needs evolve. Decisions regarding visual and interactive design aspects are tightly grounded on a conceptual model for exploratory search. In other words, the different views in the user interface address stages of awareness, exploration, and explanation unfolding along the discovery process, supported by a set of text-mining methods. A formal evaluation showed that gathering items relevant to a particular topic of interest with our tool incurs in a lower cognitive load compared to a traditional ranked list. A second study reports on usage patterns and usability of the various interaction techniques within a free, unsupervised setting.},

abstract = {It is essential that users understand how algorithmic decisions are made, as we increasingly delegate important decisions to intelligent systems. Prior work has often taken a techno-centric approach, focusing on new computational techniques to support transparency. In contrast, this article employs empirical methods to better understand user reactions to transparent systems to motivate user-centric designs for transparent systems. We assess user reactions to transparency feedback in four studies of an emotional analytics system. In Study 1, users anticipated that a transparent system would perform better but unexpectedly retracted this evaluation after experience with the system. Study 2 offers an explanation for this paradox by showing that the benefits of transparency are context dependent. On the one hand, transparency can help users form a model of the underlying algorithm's operation. On the other hand, positive accuracy perceptions may be undermined when transparency reveals algorithmic errors. Study 3 explored real-time reactions to transparency. Results confirmed Study 2, in showing that users are both more likely to consult transparency information and to experience greater system insights when formulating a model of system operation. Study 4 used qualitative methods to explore real-time user reactions to motivate transparency design principles. Results again suggest that users may benefit from initially simplified feedback that hides potential system errors and assists users in building working heuristics about system operation. We use these findings to motivate new progressive disclosure principles for transparency in intelligent systems and discuss theoretical implications.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in image retrieval systems for medical decision making. One application of ML is to retrieve visually similar medical images from past patients (e.g. tissue from biopsies) to reference when making a medical decision with a new patient. However, no algorithm can perfectly capture an expert's ideal notion of similarity for every case: an image that is algorithmically determined to be similar may not be medically relevant to a doctor's specific diagnostic needs. In this paper, we identified the needs of pathologists when searching for similar images retrieved using a deep learning algorithm, and developed tools that empower users to cope with the search algorithm on-the-fly, communicating what types of similarity are most important at different moments in time. In two evaluations with pathologists, we found that these tools increased the diagnostic utility of images found and increased user trust in the algorithm. The tools were preferred over a traditional interface, without a loss in diagnostic accuracy. We also observed that users adopted new strategies when using refinement tools, re-purposing them to test and understand the underlying algorithm and to disambiguate ML errors from their own errors. Taken together, these findings inform future human-ML collaborative systems for expert decision-making.},

This chapter emphasizes the representations that are formed, as people understand a sentence and the processes involved in developing these representations. This involves recognizing the words in the sentence, determining the syntactic and semantic relationships among the words and phrases, and interpreting contextually dependent expressions. These processes draw upon specifically linguistic knowledge as well as knowledge about the world and the specific context of a sentence or utterance. This chapter also discusses the central theoretical perspectives and empirical questions that are guiding current research on sentence comprehension, and some historical perspective on how the field has developed. In Adoing so, it focuses primarily on the problem of how readers and listeners determine grammatical relationships as they are processing a sentence. In addition, the chapter also addresses the questions of how people pronounce words and nonwords, the effects of brain injury on performance, the role of phonological and morphological information in word recognition, the effects of differences among orthographies, the use of different decoding strategies, and the role of contextual information."
