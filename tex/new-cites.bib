aabstract = {Clinical practice is heavily reliant on the use of unstructured text to document patient
stories due to its expressive and flexible nature. However, a physician's capacity
to recover information from text for clinical overview is severely affected when records
get longer and time pressure increases. Data visualization strategies have been explored
to aid in information retrieval by replacing text with graphical summaries, though
often at the cost of omitting important text features. This causes physician mistrust
and limits real-world adoption. This work presents our investigation into the role
and use of text in clinical practice, and reports on efforts to assess the best of
both worlds---text and visualization---to facilitate clinical overview. We report
on insights garnered from a field study, and the lessons learned from an iterative
design process and evaluation of a text-visualization prototype, MedStory, with 14
medical professionals. The results led to a number of grounded design recommendations
to guide visualization design to support clinical text overview.},

aabstract = {User studies are important for many aspects of the design process and involve techniques ranging from informal surveys to rigorous laboratory studies. However, the costs involved in engaging users often requires practitioners to trade off between sample size, time requirements, and monetary costs. Micro-task markets, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, offer a potential paradigm for engaging a large number of users for low time and monetary costs. Here we investigate the utility of a micro-task market for collecting user measurements, and discuss design considerations for developing remote micro user evaluation tasks. Although micro-task markets have great potential for rapidly collecting user measurements at low costs, we found that special care is needed in formulating tasks in order to harness the capabilities of the approach.},
