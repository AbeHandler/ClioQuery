We define five major user interface design patterns from prior work devoted to helping users understand news archives and other corpora (Section \ref{s:related}).
Three of the design patterns focus on helping users gain an overview of archive contents (top two rows).
Two of the design patterns focus on helping the user to search for specific documents or passages from a corpus (bottom row).
Following Tidwell \cite{Tidwell}, this figure presents prototypical wireframes of each design pattern, created by the authors of this work. 
Each example above shows a system presenting results from 129 documents matching the query ``NAFTA'' on a corpus of \textit{New York Times} editorials published between 1988 and 1994.
