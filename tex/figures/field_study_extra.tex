This particular example comes from our field study (Section \ref{s:fieldstudy}), where one historian commented on the advantages of the \ours~interface over a baseline \Baselongname~system.
\textit{ ``What can I do here [with \ours] that I can't do there [with \textit{New York Times} search]?"} she said. 
\textit{``It's exploring this left-hand Document Feed.''}
Where \ours~facilitates quick and comprehensive review of all query mentions, the \Baselongname~tool requires the user to read unnecessary passages and context switch across documents.
