  A user investigates Sally Ride by performing {\burdensome~and analysis} using the \textit{New York Times} web archive \cite{nytwebsite}, a baseline keyword document search interface (Section \ref{s:baseline}). They first (1) click the top headline on the search engine results page (left) in order to (2) {open} a document in a new tab (shown on the right) and then (3) scroll down to {locate} mentions of ``Ride'' in the linked news story. The user {reads} and analyzes these mentions and then (4) context switches to the second document by clicking the second headline on the results page. This (5) opens a new story in a new tab. For this second document, they (6) use a search in document feature \cite{chromeF} (i.e.\ \texttt{Control+F}) to help {locate} mentions of ``Ride'' within the story.

 A user (1) searches for ``Ride'' using \ours~and (2) sets the filter-by-count slider to limit results to stories with at least two mentions of ``Ride''. The user then clicks the expand/collapse button on two news stories (3 and 4) to review all mentions of Ride from each story in the Document Feed. They then (5) click one shortened sentence mentioning ``Ride'' (6) to read it within the context of the full original document in the linked Document Viewer, with help from automatic in-text highlighting. The user then prepares to (7) click expand to review additional mentions of Ride in the next story.}\label{f:field_study_2}
