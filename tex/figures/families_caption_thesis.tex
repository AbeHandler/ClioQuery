We define five major user interface design patterns from prior work devoted to helping users understand news archives and other corpora (Section \ref{s:related}). 
Following Tidwell \cite{Tidwell}, this figure presents prototypical wireframes of each design pattern, created by the authors of this work. 
Each example above shows a system presenting results from 129 documents matching the query ``NAFTA'' on a corpus of \textit{New York Times} editorials published between 1988 and 1994.
