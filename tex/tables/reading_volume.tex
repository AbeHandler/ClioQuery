\caption[A quantitative view of how \ours~eases reading burden]{
Total tokens presented to a historian, if each mention of the query ``Reagan'' and subquery ``Duarte'' is shown within the context of a full document ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{full doc.}}$), a full sentence  ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{full sent.}}$) or a shortened sentence ($\mathcal{C}_{s^\prime}$).
By showing shortened sentences, \ours~removes 87.0\% of tokens from all documents containing a query mention, and 41.6\% of tokens from all sentences containing a query mention.
In some cases, removing such tokens will exclude potentially relevant information from the summary; 
in these circumstances, a person would have to find and review such information using the Document Viewer.
Counts come from the example in Figure  \ref{f:system_cc}, using the Salvador corpus (Appendix) and assuming \ours~is shown on a 13-inch screen.
