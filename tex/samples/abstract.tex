Historians and archivists often find and analyze the occurrences of query words in newspaper archives, to help answer fundamental questions about society.
But much work in text analytics focuses on helping people investigate other textual units, such as events, clusters, ranked documents, entity relationships, or thematic hierarchies.
Informed by a study into the needs of historians and archivists, we thus propose \ours, a text analytics system uniquely organized around the analysis of query words in context.
\ours~applies text simplification techniques from natural language processing to help historians quickly and comprehensively gather and analyze all occurrences of a query word across an archive. 
It also pairs these new NLP methods with more traditional features like linked views and in-text highlighting to help engender trust in summarization techniques.
We evaluate \ours~with two separate user studies, in which historians explain how \ours's novel text simplification features can help facilitate historical research. 
We also evaluate with a separate quantitative comparison study, which shows that \ours~helps crowdworkers find and remember historical information.
Such results suggest possible new directions for text analytics in other query-oriented settings.
