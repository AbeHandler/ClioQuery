\subsection*{Field study: additional details}

To help $H1$ answer their question using \ours, we gathered a custom corpus of articles from \textit{The New York Times} (NYT). To gather the corpus, we searched for ``El Salvador'' on \textit{The New York Times} website \cite{nytwebsite}, and then automatically downloaded all query-matching articles published between 1980 and 1985 in the World News and Week in Review sections of the newspaper. 
We filtered downloaded articles to create a corpus of NYT articles containing the word ``Salvador,'' and we loaded this corpus into \ours~for $H1$. 

To help $H2$ answer their research question, we similarly gathered a second custom corpus of articles by searching for ``astronaut'' on the \textit{New York Times} website \cite{nytwebsite}, and then automatically downloading all query-matching articles published between 1980 and 1985. We then similarly filtered the documents to ensure that all query-matching mentioned ``astronaut'' and loaded the corpus into \ours~for $H2$.
